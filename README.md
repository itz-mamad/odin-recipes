# odin-recipes

Only HTML has been used in this small project. It was done for “The Odin Project” and my skill at that time was only a general and beginner knowledge of HTML.
The project was done on April 1st, 2023, but I forgot to set up the README.MD file, so I'm doing it now on May 31, 2023.
I may add CSS and make it more like a website when I got a better Developer.
