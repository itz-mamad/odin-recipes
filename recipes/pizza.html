    <h3>A cheesy casserole with all of your favorite pizza toppings. I like to serve this with a salad and garlic bread. The leftovers are great. I have prepared this in advance and then taken it to potlucks in a slow cooker the next day.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package uncooked egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (2.25 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
        <li>1 (2.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced pepperoni, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>20 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cook the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink, breaking the meat apart into crumbles as it cooks, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the egg noodles in the boiling water until cooked through yet slightly firm, about 5 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Mix the noodles with the cooked ground beef, spaghetti sauce, black olives, mushrooms, pepperoni, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese in a large mixing bowl. Spoon the mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish and top with remaining cheese. Cover the dish with foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
